			&nbsp &nbsp	Hello Everyone! My name is Mark Edzel Gabuya, I am 19 yearls old and my
			birthday was on August 19,2001. I finished my Junior and Senior High School with Honors at Rizal High School. I am a First year college student and
			currently taking Bachelor Science in Infomation and Technology at 
			Pamantasang Lungsod ng Pasig. I chose this course because I really
			want to become a succesful programmer in a near future. Also, I
			decided to took this course because I atleast have a basic 
			knowledge about programming. Application programmer is the job position I see myself after graduation .
			Honestly speaking, I don't have any talent or skils. I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. 
			There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. 
			I like to read the books about mystery, I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen.
			I like to see the moonlight at night;  I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, 
			I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.

				<br>
				<br>
				
			
			&nbsp &nbsp	There are 6 of us in my family. My father's name is Edwin Ibuos and
			He is 56 years old. My father is a hardworking fish vendor for about 20 years,
			he is also able to do many different things in our home. Second, My mother is
			36 years old but she looks much younger, her name is Mariciris Gabuya and she is a beautiful housewife.
			She always take care of us and she's very kind. I've got an elder sister named Camela Gabuya. She is 22
			years old and she is currently working at BPO. She likes to treat us on her payday. My sister also likes cooking,
			watching k-dramas and reading books. My little sister is only 16 years old and her name is Jeanela Ibuos, She is currenty a grade 9 students at
			Rizal High School. Lastly, My little brother is only 5 years old and his name is Carl Ibuos.
